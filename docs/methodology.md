# Game Theory Policy Analysis: Research Methodology

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive research methodology used to analyze economic policy decisions through game theory frameworks, specifically comparing tariff-based trade policies with STEM education investment strategies. Our analysis employs both theoretical game theory models and empirical machine learning validation to demonstrate that STEM investment represents a dominant strategy for national economic competitiveness.

## 1. Theoretical Framework

### 1.1 Game Theory Foundation

Our analysis is built on classical game theory principles, specifically:

- **Nash Equilibrium Analysis**: Finding stable strategy profiles where no player can unilaterally improve their payoff
- **Dominant Strategy Identification**: Strategies that perform optimally regardless of opponents' choices
- **Prisoner's Dilemma vs Positive-Sum Games**: Distinguishing between competitive and cooperative scenarios

### 1.2 Policy Modeling Approach

We model international economic competition as a strategic game where:

```
Players: National economies (US, China, EU, etc.)
Strategies: {Tariff Protection, STEM Investment, Status Quo}
Payoffs: Economic competitiveness metrics
```

### 1.3 Mathematical Framework

#### Nash Equilibrium Calculation
For a 2-player, 2-strategy game with payoff matrices A and B:

```
Nash Equilibrium: (x*, y*) where
x* ∈ argmax_x x^T A y*
y* ∈ argmax_y x*^T B y
```

#### Dominant Strategy Test
Strategy s_i dominates s_j if:
```
∀ opponent strategies: π(s_i, s_{-i}) ≥ π(s_j, s_{-i})
```

## 2. Data Sources and Collection

### 2.1 Primary Data Sources

| Data Type | Source | Frequency | Variables |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Employment Data | Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) | Monthly/Annual | Employment by occupation, education level |
| Economic Indicators | Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) | Quarterly | GDP growth, sector contributions |
| Education Statistics | National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) | Biennial | Student performance metrics |
| Trade Data | U.S. Trade Representative | Monthly | Tariff rates, import/export volumes |
| Innovation Metrics | National Science Foundation | Annual | R&D spending, patent applications |

### 2.2 Data Validation Protocol

1. **Source Credibility**: Only government and peer-reviewed sources
2. **Temporal Consistency**: Data aligned to common time periods
3. **Cross-Validation**: Multiple sources for key metrics
4. **Missing Data Handling**: Conservative imputation methods

## 3. Game Theory Analysis

### 3.1 Payoff Matrix Construction

Payoffs calculated based on:

```python
def calculate_payoff(strategy, economic_indicators):
    """
    Payoff = α(GDP_growth) + β(Employment_rate) + γ(Innovation_index) 
           - δ(Implementation_costs) - ε(Opportunity_costs)
    """
    return weighted_sum(indicators, strategy_weights[strategy])
```

### 3.2 Scenario Modeling

#### Base Scenarios
1. **Current Policy**: Mixed tariff/education approach
2. **High Tariff**: 25%+ tariffs, reduced education funding
3. **STEM Investment**: Increased education funding, low tariffs
4. **International Competition**: Other nations' optimal responses

#### Sensitivity Analysis
- Vary payoff weights (α, β, γ, δ, ε) within ±20%
- Test different discount rates for long-term benefits
- Analyze robustness across different time horizons

### 3.3 Nash Equilibrium Solutions

Our analysis identifies multiple equilibria:

1. **Cooperative Equilibrium**: (STEM Investment, STEM Investment) - Pareto optimal
2. **Competitive Equilibrium**: (Tariffs, Tariffs) - Prisoner's dilemma outcome
3. **Mixed Strategy Equilibrium**: Probabilistic combinations

## 4. Machine Learning Validation

### 4.1 Model Architecture

We employ multiple ML algorithms to validate game theory predictions:

```python
models = {
    'Random Forest': RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100),
    'Gradient Boosting': GradientBoostingRegressor(),
    'Support Vector Regression': SVR(kernel='rbf'),
    'Neural Network': MLPRegressor(hidden_layers=[100, 50])
}
```

### 4.2 Feature Engineering

Key features extracted from policy scenarios:
- Education spending per capita
- Tariff rate weighted by trade volume
- R&D investment as % of GDP
- Human capital development indices
- International competitiveness rankings

### 4.3 Cross-Validation Protocol

5-fold cross-validation with:
- Temporal splits (train on past, test on future)
- Geographic splits (train on some countries, test on others)
- Policy regime splits (train on one policy type, test on another)

### 4.4 Performance Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Interpretation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| RMSE | √(Σ(y_pred - y_actual)²/n) | Prediction accuracy |
| R² Score | 1 - (SS_res/SS_tot) | Explained variance |
| MAE | Σ|y_pred - y_actual|/n | Average error magnitude |
| MAPE | Σ|error/actual|*100/n | Percentage error |

## 5. Statistical Significance Testing

### 5.1 Hypothesis Testing Framework

**Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: No significant difference between tariff and STEM investment strategies
**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: STEM investment significantly outperforms tariffs

### 5.2 Statistical Tests Applied

1. **Paired t-test**: Comparing policy outcomes within countries
2. **Mann-Whitney U**: Non-parametric comparison across strategies
3. **Bootstrap confidence intervals**: Robust estimation of effect sizes
4. **Permutation tests**: Distribution-free significance testing

### 5.3 Multiple Testing Correction

Applied Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons:
```
α_corrected = α_original / number_of_tests
```

## 6. Economic Impact Quantification

### 6.1 Cost-Benefit Analysis Framework

#### STEM Investment Costs
- Direct education funding increases
- Infrastructure development
- Teacher training and recruitment
- Opportunity costs of delayed implementation

#### STEM Investment Benefits
- Increased high-skill employment
- Innovation spillovers
- Long-term GDP growth
- International competitiveness gains

#### Tariff Policy Costs
- Consumer price increases
- Retaliatory measures
- Efficiency losses
- International relationship damage

### 6.2 Time-Discounted Analysis

Net Present Value calculation:
```
NPV = Σ[Benefits_t - Costs_t] / (1 + r)^t
```

Where r = social discount rate (typically 3-7% annually)

## 7. Model Validation and Robustness

### 7.1 Historical Back-Testing

Validate predictions against historical policy implementations:
- South Korea's education investment (1960s-1980s)
- Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act outcomes (1930s)
- Finland's PISA education reforms (1990s-2000s)

### 7.2 Out-of-Sample Testing

Reserve 20% of data for final validation:
- Geographic holdout: Test on unseen countries
- Temporal holdout: Test on recent policy changes
- Policy holdout: Test on novel policy combinations

### 7.3 Robustness Checks

1. **Alternative model specifications**
2. **Different data aggregation methods**
3. **Varying time windows for analysis**
4. **Sensitivity to outlier removal**
5. **Bootstrap resampling validation**
